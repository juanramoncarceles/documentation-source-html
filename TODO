BUGS:
  ☐ Process 'index.xml' titles to remove HTML entitites?
    In the index.xml there are title attributes with values that contain HTML entities and should be parsed: "laPlanta &gt; Desde puntos"
  ☐ If there is no data about translations the Language switcher component should not appear.
  ☐ If a file in the contents folder changes, then Gatsby doesn't process it again because it uses cache.
    The problem is that if html is not processed images and anchors remain unchanged so they are wrong.
    Solution now is to delete cache and start again.
  ☐ 404 page is not language specific.
  ☐ String of the main layout are hardcoded in English and should be translated. @critical 
  ☐ When navigating from one page to another and the url has a hash, it navigates twice, first OK with the hash, but second without, so the url loses the hash and scroll is top.

CHANGES:
  ☐ Currently languages available are hardcoded in the language component, change to fetch them instead. @high 
  ☐ Convert to a plugin, even local to make it more modular and access the plugin options this way:
    exports.onPreInit = function (args, options) {
      if (options.excludeRegex && !options.excludePattern) {
        options.excludePattern = options.excludeRegex
      }
      if (options.excludePattern) {
        options.excludePattern = options.excludePattern.source
      }
    }
  ☐ Add lang code to urls in gatsby-node.js instead than in the IndexItem component. @low 
  ☐ Use a resolver for the translations field so it doesn't have to be passed through page context.
  ☐ Process only images used in the HTML docs instead of all the images.
    An easy option is to create two identical home pages, one with the locale an another without.
  ☐ Since pathObj.file in gatsby-node.js is always used with .toLowerCase() it could be stored lower case. It makes sense because file names are case insensitive.
  ☐ Make the logs about the errors with html anchors replacement also with the Gatsby reporter.


FEATURES:
  ☐ Enable the offline plugin to make it a PWA so it can be installed and use notifications.
  ☐ Css and Js for the index of items. Probably they could be folded and expanded.
  ☐ Open the index tree automatically according to the current doc. For example after searching.
  ☐ Add an index for the page anchor/sections if any (Table of contents). Like in the Tailwind docs pages.
    Use the html rehype plugin which gives the 'tableOfContents' based on the headers of the doc.
  ☐ Make the index side bar resizable by dragging.
  ☐ Pass a globarl variable to decide if logging the custom warnings about missing traslations and other.
  ☐ Nested lists change bullet style.
  ☐ Implement the image map on the toolbar icons? Would it work in responsive? usemap="#VegetationToolbarMap"
  ☐ 404 page should display links to the main pages of the site.
  ☐ Use gatsby image manually to imitate the behaviour of inlining the base64 images by default?
  ☐ Allow to always search in english? Maybe this makes sense with different indexes? @low


IMAGES:
  ☐ For image extensions that are not supported by Sharp like gif they should be just copied into the public folder like in the rehype-images plugin.

  ☐ Images are working, but currently their sources are replaced using a regular expression, if there are problems use an AST instead.
    Since the rehype plugin has been added, the replacement could be done in the AST of the HTML that it provides. Similar to its image plugin
    https://github.com/styxlab/gatsby-theme-try-ghost/blob/master/packages/gatsby-rehype-inline-images/src/gatsby-node.js

    It could be done when the LandsDesignDoc node passes, since it would have the field 'childHtmlRehype.htmlAst'.
    Another options is to create the LandsDesignDoc nodes from the HtmlRehype nodes instead than the html (the Rehype nodes have a 'htmlAst' field).

    // Instead of doing...
    if (node.internal.type === "File" && node.internal.mediaType === "text/html") {
      //...
    }
  
    // It would be...  
    if (node.internal.type === "HtmlRehype") {
      const parent = getNode(node.parent);
      if (parent.sourceInstanceName === doc) {
        // Same as now... and check that they only pass once...
      }
    }

    Also it could be worth to check how the mdx plugin or the source wordpress are doing it, since they also use an AST from which image src are replaced

DONE:
  ✔ Language switcher. @high @done(20-12-13 17:02)
  ✔ Each page title should be the one translated. Currently it is the file name (which is always in eng and with underscores). @done(20-12-18 00:12)
  ✔ Process anchor elements in HTML doc files to point to the right urls. @high @done(20-12-30 13:32)
  ✔ When auto scrolling to an anchor use something like `scroll-margin-top: 6.875rem;` on the element with the id. @done(21-01-13 11:06)
  ✔ Use the existing css file (LandsDesign.css) to style the HTML that comes from the source files. @done(21-01-13 11:07)
  ✔ Set in the config which is the locale to be used as main language, mainly to be able to hide it from the url. @done(21-01-15 15:47)
  ✔ The anchor elements in the HTML docs should behave like the Gatsby's Link, try to use the gatsby-plugin-catch-links to change their behaviour. @done(21-01-20 16:15)
  ✔ It is not responsive. @done(21-01-22 18:32)
  ✔ In Firefox on small screens the side navigation has an incorrect position. @critical @done(21-01-29 18:21)
  ✔ Search bar. At least for the name of the pages / commands / headings. @done(21-02-03 14:42)
  ✔ When selecting a page from the index it rerenders with scroll top but it should maintain the scroll position. @done(21-02-11 13:15)

REJECTED:
  ✘ Create schema customization also for the custom fields? @cancelled(21-01-20 12:02)

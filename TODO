BUGS:
  ☐ Process anchor elements in HTML doc files to point to the right urls. @high 
  ☐ Each page title should be the one translated. Currently it is the file name (which is always in eng and with underscores).
  ☐ Process 'index.xml' titles to remove HTML entitites?
    In the index.xml there are title attributes with values that contain HTML entities and should be parsed: "laPlanta &gt; Desde puntos"


CHANGES:
  ☐ Add lang code to urls in gatsby-node.js instead than in the IndexItem component. @low 
  ☐ Set in the config which is the locale to be used as main language, mainly to be able to hide it from the url.
    An easy option is to create two identical home pages, one with the locale an another without.


FEATURES:
  ☐ Search bar.
  ☐ Add an index for the page anchor/sections if any. Like in the Tailwind docs pages.
    Use the html rehype plugin which gives the 'tableOfContents' based on the headers of the doc.
  ☐ Make the index side bar resizable by dragging.


IMAGES:
  ☐ For image extensions that are not supported by Sharp like gif they should be just copied into the public folder like in the rehype-images plugin.

  ☐ Images are working, but currently their sources are replaced using a regular expression, if there are problems use an AST instead.
    Since the rehype plugin has been added, the replacement could be done in the AST of the HTML that it provides. Similar to its image plugin
    https://github.com/styxlab/gatsby-theme-try-ghost/blob/master/packages/gatsby-rehype-inline-images/src/gatsby-node.js

    It could be done when the LandsDesignDoc node passes, since it would have the field 'childHtmlRehype.htmlAst'.
    Another options is to create the LandsDesignDoc nodes from the HtmlRehype nodes instead than the html (the Rehype nodes have a 'htmlAst' field).

    // Instead of doing...
    if (node.internal.type === "File" && node.internal.mediaType === "text/html") {
      //...
    }
  
    // It would be...  
    if (node.internal.type === "HtmlRehype") {
      const parent = getNode(node.parent);
      if (parent.sourceInstanceName === doc) {
        // Same as now... and check that they only pass once...
      }
    }

    Also it could be worth to check how the mdx plugin or the source wordpress are doing it, since they also use an AST from which image src are replaced

DONE:
  ✔ Language switcher. @high @done(20-12-13 17:02)

<h3>Render</h3>

<p>Lands Design objects, including all 3D representations of plants, civil work elements, terrains and zones, integrate textured materials that are compatible with any <strong>render engine</strong> that works on Rhino. </p>

<p>Lands includes a library of materials that are assigned by default to the different Lands Design objects. These materials are stored in the following directory: C:\ProgramData\AsuniCAD\Lands\Rhinoceros (64-bit)\Textures</p>
<p>The object material assignment works as in Rhino, but it can also be managed from the Material's tab, in the different dialogs where you can edit the Lands object Properties.</p>

<h3>Realistic Plants and Groundcovers</h3>

<p>The realistic representation for Plants and Groundcovers uses specific file formats (<em>*.ArTree, *.ArPlantX</em> and <em>*.ArGroundcoverX</em>) that are generated with two versions of a Plant Editor application. The old version of it (Plant Editor) is integrated in Lands Design and generates "nXt" Plants (<em>*.ArPlantX</em> and <em>*.ArGroundcoverX</em> formats).</p>
<p>The new version of this plant editor (AccuRender Plant Editor) generates the <em>*.ArTree</em> files.</p>
<p>Both versions of the <strong>Plant Editor</strong> lets you play with a series of parameters whose values determine the appearance of the plant, for example the plant height, the arching and density of the branches, the thickness, the sinuosity of the trunk, etc. 
These values are saved as definition files that are used by the Realistic representation of vegetation elements.</p>
<p>These realistinc plant files integrate all textures for the plant trunk, leaves, flowers or fruits and can store different definitions that are assigned to different seasons. They use very realistic 3D plants for rendering and textured low-poly plants for the real-time display. Their textures are compatible with any renderer engine available for Rhino, like V-Ray, Brazil, Maxwell, etc.</p>

<p>The following Render properties are available in the Edit panel:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Season</strong>: when the <em>Ignore global season</em> box is 
	checked, the user can choose in which season the plants will be rendered, 
	choosing from the 7 values available: Early spring, Spring, Late spring, 
	Summer, Late summer, Autumn, and Winter.</li>
	<li><strong>Foliage density</strong>: the plants will be rendered with more or less leaves depending on the level chosen.</li>
</ul>

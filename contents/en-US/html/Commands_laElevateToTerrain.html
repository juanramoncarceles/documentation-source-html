<p>The <strong>laElevateToTerrain</strong> command moves any kind of object vertically until it lies onto a Lands Design 
terrain surface, or onto an object that has been <a href="Commands_laTagObjectAsTerrain.html">tagged as a terrain</a> (the one located in a higher elevation).</p>
<p>If the object to move is composed by different items, such as a Forest or a Row, each item will be projected on the terrain surface.</p>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

<ol>
 <li>Select the <strong>object</strong> to adjust onto a terrain.</li>
 </ol>
<p>The selected object will recognize the terrain surface and will be projected on it. The object will remain attached onto the terrain surface. If the terrain relief is modified, the object will update its position automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: if the object is placed outside of the terrain limits, it will remain in the same elevation position until it finds a terrain area underneath.</p>
